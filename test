Equity Vol Carry

Rationale
	On average, equity implied volatility tends to trade at a premium to subsequent realised volatility as investors demand a risk premium for selling optionality and being short volatility. This preference is driven by risk aversion, i.e. some market participants attach a higher value to being long protection
Construction
	Vol Carry World sells short-dated options (puts and calls) daily on global indexes and delta hedges. It buys back lower puts to mitigate drawdown's without diluting the underlying alpha drivers.
Diversification
	Vol carry is a cyclical factor, and has experienced some of the larger drawdowns in coincidence to the equity market, with which is positively correlated.
Persistence
	Volatility Carry is a very persistent and high Sharpe factor.

Equity Low Beta

Rationale
	This factor attempts to capture the Risk adjusted outperformance of stocks with low beta to the market index vs. those with higher beta. Investors with long-only and leverage constraints prefer higher beta stocks, as it is often the only way to beat a trending benchmark.
Construction
	Each stock’s beta to the market is calculated. The target portfolio goes long the bottom quintile, weighted in  proportion to their negative beta
Diversification
	The low beta factor is defensive in nature, with negative correlations to the more cyclical equity market, short vol and Value, and a positive correlation with quality. Coupled with the latter it can acts as a good diversifier of risk
Persistence
	Low beta stocks have been consistent outperformers in the back tested period.

Size

Rationale
	Rational / Information Processing: Small caps tend to be less transparent and as a consequence are perceived to
Construction
	This factor attempts to capture the outperformance of smaller versus larger companies
Diversification
	Similarly to Value Size is a cyclical factor, exhibiting negative correlation to Momentum and quality.
Persistence
	Small caps tend to thrive in positive markets, while tougher market environments are detrimental to the size premium
Academic Literature
	Fama-French 1993 - “Common Risk Factors in the returns on stocks and bonds”

Value
Rationale
	Value stocks are risky because they might be “Cheap” for a good reason. Value is a cyclical factor, which works  well  in combination to quality and momentum signals
Construction
	Each stock is given a value score using a mix of book to price and forward looking earnings yield. The target portfolio goes long the top quintile and short the bottom quintile, weighted in proportion to their value scores.
Diversification
	Value is negatively correlated to the defensive factors (low beta and quality ), as well as momentum, and it is in this interaction that this factor has added performance.
Persistence
	Value is a markedly cyclical factor, experiencing marked draw downs in contractionary markets, and sharp rallies in bull markets, especially following market bottoms
Academic Literature
	Fama-French 1993 - “Common Risk Factors in the returns on stocks and bonds”
	
Momentum
Rationale
	This factor attempts to capture the outperformance of the past winners versus the past losers. Based on formation times up to 12 months. Information uncertainty causes dispersion of news to be gradual. Reacting to price dynamics allows to focus on positions several Investors tend to avoid because of the information risk.
Construction
	For each stock we calculate its momentum and its volatility between one year ago and one month ago. We then rank these based on how much the momentum outperforms the others on a volatility-adjusted basis. The target portfolio goes long the top quintile and short the bottom quintile, weighted in proportion to their outperformance.
Diversification
	Momentum has historically been a good “hedge” for value strategies, while bearing a low correlation to other  factors 
Persistence
	Momentum is marked by positive persistent performance, marked by sharp draw downs around market bottoms.

	Hong-Stein 1999 - “A Unified Theory of Underreaction, Momentum Trading, and Overreaction in Asset Markets”
		
	
Quality
Rationale
	This factor attempts to capture the outperformance of stocks that have a strong balance sheet vs. stocks that have a weaker balance sheet. Stocks with strong balance sheets tend to trade at higher multiples, and appear less likely to outperform. Investors therefore underestimate the ability of these to perform in a flight to quality environment.
Construction
	We take each stock’s Worldscope rating on each of seven balance sheet items such as accruals, leverage and asset turnover. The ratings are standardized, and the target portfolio goes long the top quintile and short the bottom quintile, weighted in proportion to their average standardized rating.
Diversificatio
	The quality factor is defensive in nature, with negative correlations to the more cyclical equity market, short vol and Value and a positive correlation with low beta. Coupled with the latter it 
	acts as a good diversifier of market risk
Persistence
	The performance of Quality is in line with its defensive nature, experiencing unimpressive returns in growth periods, and capturing the flight to quality in tougher ones.

Credit Vol Carry

Rationale
	On average, credit implied volatility tends to trade at a premium to subsequent realised volatility as investors demand a risk premium for selling optionality and being short volatility. This preference is driven by risk aversion, i.e. market participants attach a higher value to being long protection
Construction
	Credit Volatility Carry sells short-dated options (puts and calls) on itraxx Xover and delta hedges on a daily basis.
Diversificatio
	Vol carry is a cyclical factor, and has experienced some of the larger drawdowns in coincidence to the equity market, with which is positively correlated
Persistence
	Volatility Carry is a very persistent and high Sharpe factor.

	Bondarenko (2003) - “Why are Put Options So Expensive?“


Credit Curve

Rationale
	In general, investors tend to prefer higher beta assets compared to lower beta assets. This phenomena also persists in credit space where it gets exacerbated by the fact that given a similar rating, investors generally tend to prefer higher yield lower yield which leads to a relative compression of 10y spreads vs. 5y.
Construction
	Credit Curve Strategy sells short-dated (5y) protection and buys long-dated (10y) protection while maintaining DV01 neutrality
Diversificatio
	Credit curve positioning is a cyclical factor, and has experienced some of the larger drawdowns in coincidence to the equity market, with which is positively correlated.
Persistence
	Credit Curve can achieve positive performance by a curve steepening and/or positive curve roll-down.

TS Momentum
Rationale
	This factor capitalizes on the persistence of trends in short and medium-term interest rate movements which tend to be gradual and mainly driven by monetary policy
Construction
	On a daily basis, the strategy evaluates the recent performance of a number of futures contracts (with underlyings of less than 5 year maturity) for US , Germany and Australia. It then takes either a long or short position on each of the futures depending on whether their actual performance has been positive or negative.
Diversification
	Trend/momentum strategies are typically used as a diversification tool on high volatility environments.
Persistence
	The time series momentum strategy capitalizes on the trending behaviour of interest rate markets it can perform poorly in non-directional market environments.
Academic Literature

Bond Spread

Rationale
	This factor captures the observation that risk adjusted returns at the short-end of the curve tend to be higher than at the long-end. A leverage long position on the former vs. the latter tends to capture positive excess return as a compensation for risk premium that stems from investors having leverage constraints which favour long-term rates.
Construction
	The Bond Spread strategy enters a long position on Two-year US Bond futures and a short position on Ten-year US Bond futures, rolling every quarter. The exposure to each future is adjusted to approximate a Duration-Neutral position.
Diversification
	The curve steepens during recession as a result of agents in the economy requiring higher risk premium, thus this factor will tend to be counter cyclical or defensive.
Persistence
	Historically, the curve tends to be steeper at the front end than at the long end of the curve.
Academic Literature

	Frazzini & Pedersen, 2013 – “Betting Against Beta”

IR Curve Term Premium

Rationale
	This factor attempts to benefit from term premium at the short-end of the curve, mainly from the observation that short-term interest rate forwards tend to over estimate the actual realization of the spot. This term premium typically tends to be higher the longer the tenor of the forward contract
Construction
	IR Curve strategy enters a long position on the 4th Eurodollar futures contracts and a short position on the 2nd Eurodollar futures contract, rolling such position on a quarterly basis. A spread position allows to reduce interest rate directionality
Diversification
	Term premium tends to be countercyclical, being higher at recessions that in expansions. As a consequence the IR Curve strategy provides good diversification benefits against pro-cyclical asset classes such as the equity market.
Persistence
	Historically the curve tends to be upward sloping, thus persistence of excess returns should generally be expected. However the strategy can suffer losses when the curve steepens

FX Carry and FX Value
Rationale
	The FX Carry strategy has historically benefited from the tendency of FX forwards of high yielding currencies to overestimate the actual depreciation of future FX spot. The FX Valuation strategy relies on exchange rates reverting back to their fair value in the medium to long-term horizons.
Construction
	The FX Carry + Valuation strategy is an equally weighted basket of an FX Carry and an FX Valuation index. Each of them takes FX forwards contracts positions on a diversified basket of currencies selected from a wide universe of Emerging Market & G10 economies according to a systematic rule.
Diversification
	Combining a carry plus a valuation strategy tends to exhibit a stable path of returns. The correlation either to risk on or risk off assets tends to be low.
Persistence
	The FX Carry and FX Valuation strategies have historically exhibited low or negative correlation with each other. The latter has historically tended to perform well when there is an increase in general risk aversion whereas the former generally performs best in low risk aversion environments.

FX Momentum
Rationale
	This factor capitalizes on the persistence of trends in forward exchange rate movements which are driven both by carry as well as spot movements.
Construction
	monthly basis, the strategy evaluates the recent performance of 27 currencies against the USD. It then takes a long or short position on 12 currencies depending on whether their actual performance against the USD was positive or On a negative
Diversification
	Trend/momentum strategies are typically used as a diversification tool on high volatility environments.
Persistence
	The FX Momentum strategy capitalizes on the trending behaviour of FX markets. It can perform poorly in non- directional market environments. Since the actual investment is done on FX forwards the strategy captures trends on both the spot as well as the carry movements.

FX Carry Index

Rationale
	The FX Carry strategy has historically benefited from the tendency of FX forwards of high yielding currencies to overestimate the actual depreciation of future FX spot.
Construction
	On a monthly basis, the strategy evaluates the implied carry rate (FX Forward vs FX Spot) of a number of currencies (G10 & EM) against the USD and ranks them based on that measure. The strategy goes long single currency indices (which roll FX forwards) for the currencies with the highest carry and short single currency indices for the currencies with the lowest carry.
Diversification
	The correlation with FX Valuation tends to be low or negative.
Persistence
	The FX Carry generally performs best in low risk aversion environments
Academic Literature

FX Value

Rationale
	FX Valuation strategy relies on exchange rates reverting back to their fair value in the medium to long-term horizons.
Construction
	On a monthly basis, the strategy evaluates the valuation measure (based on DEER, “Dynamic Equilibrium Exchange Rate” model) of a number of currencies (G10 & EM) against the USD and ranks them based on that measure.  The strategy goes long single currency indices (which roll FX forwards) for the currencies with the highest ranking (i.e most undervalued) and short single currency indices for the currencies with the lowest ranking (i.e most overvalued).
Diversification
	The correlation with FX Carry tends to be low or negative.
Persistence
	The FX Valuation strategy has historically tended to perform well when there is an increase in general risk aversion

FX Momentum
Rationale
	This factor capitalizes on the persistence of trends in forward exchange rate movements which are driven both by carry as well as spot movements.
Construction
	On a daily basis, the strategy evaluates the recent performance of 27 currencies against the USD based on a momentum factor (2 year exponentially weighted moving average of the daily returns with a half life of 3m). The strategy then takes either a long or short position on each of the currencies against the USD depending on whether the sign of the momentum factor is positive or negative
Diversification
	Trend/momentum strategies are typically used as a diversification tool on high volatility environments.
Persistence
	The FX Momentum strategy capitalizes on the trending behaviour of FX markets. It can perform poorly in non-directional market environments. Since the actual investment is done on FX forwards the strategy captures trends on both the spot as well as the carry movements.

Rates Vol 10y
Rationale
	This factor attempts to benefit from the fact, that historically implied volatility has exceeded realized volatility on  treasury options
Construction
	The TY Vol Carry Strategy sells “25% delta strike strangles” (25% delta call and 25% delta put) with 1 month maturity. The position is delta hedged on a daily basis using the future expiry underlying the option.
Diversification
	The TY Vol Carry Strategy has exhibited low correlation to other Risk Premia Strategies. Daily delta hedging further reduces directional exposure of the strategy
Persistence
	Demand for short dated volatility in US markets outweighs supply. The main buyers are: Mortgage Banks and  insurers

Construction
	The RX Vol Carry Strategy sells “25% delta strike strangles” (25% delta call and 25% delta put) with 1 month maturity. The position is delta hedged on a daily basis using the future expiry underlying the option
Diversification
	The RX Vol Carry Strategy has exhibited low correlation to other Risk Premia Strategies. Daily delta hedging further reduces directional exposure of the strategy
Persistence
	Potential needs for hedging via options could outweigh supply


Rates Momentum Short End

Rationale
	This factor capitalizes on the persistence of trends in short-term interest rate movements which tend to be gradual and mainly driven by monetary policy
Construction
	On a daily basis, the strategy evaluates the recent performance of rolling rates futures indices (Eurodollar, Euribor, Short Sterling) based on a momentum factor (2 year exponentially weighted moving average of the daily returns of the rolling futures indices with a half life of 3m). The strategy then takes either a long or short position on each of the rolling futures indices depending on whether the sign of the momentum factor is positive or negative
Diversification
	Trend/momentum strategies are typically used as a diversification tool in high volatility environments.
Persistence
	The time series momentum strategy capitalizes on the trending behaviour of interest rate markets. It can perform poorly in non-directional market environments.

Rates Momentum Long End
Rationale
	This factor capitalizes on the persistence of trends in short-term interest rate movements which tend to be gradual and mainly driven by monetary policy. Those gradual changes in short term rates, together with inflation, influence rates at the long end of the curve.
Construction
	On a daily basis, the strategy evaluates the recent performance of rolling government bond futures indices (US Treasuries, Germany, UK, Japan) based on a momentum factor (2 year exponentially weighted moving average of the daily returns of the rolling futures indices with a half life of 3m). The strategy then takes either a long or short position on each of the rolling futures indices depending on whether the sign of the momentum factor is positive or negative
Diversification
	Trend/momentum strategies are typically used as a diversification tool in high volatility environments.

Carry Short End
Rationale
	This factor attempts to benefit from term premium at the short-end of the curve, mainly from the observation that short-term interest rate forwards tend to over estimate the actual realization of the spot. This term premium typically tends to be higher the longer the tenor of the forward contract.
Construction
	The Rates Curve strategy enters a long position on the 4th Eurodollar, Euribor and Short Sterling futures contracts and a short position on the 2nd Eurodollar, Euribor and Short Sterling futures contract, rolling such position on a quarterly basis. A spread position allows to reduce interest rate directionality.
Diversification
	Term premium tends to be countercyclical, being higher at recessions that in expansions. As a consequence the Bond Curve strategy provides good diversification benefits against pro-cyclical asset classes such as the equity market.
Persistence
	Historically the curve tends to be upward sloping, thus persistence of excess returns should generally be expected. However the strategy can suffer losses when when the curve steepens.
Academic Literature
	Piazzesi-Swanson 2006 - “Futures prices as risk-adjusted forecast of monetary policy”


Carry Long End
Rationale
	This factor captures the observation that risk adjusted returns at the short-end of the curve tend to be higher than at the long-end. A leveraged long position on the former vs. the latter tends to capture positive excess return as a compensation for risk premium that stems from investors having leverage constraints which favour long-term rates.
Construction
	The Bond Curve strategy enters a long position on 5y US Bond futures and a short position on 30y Bond futures, as well as along position on 5y German Schatz futures in USD and a short position on 10y German Bund futures in USD, rolling every quarter. The exposure to each future is adjusted to approximate a Duration-Neutral position.
Diversification
	The curve steepens during recession as a result of agents in the economy requiring higher risk premium, thus this factor will tend to be counter cyclical or defensive.
Persistence
	Historically, the curve tends to be steeper at the front end than at the long-end of the curve.

Calendar

Rationale
	This factor attempts to benefit from the fact, that bond indices usually are rebalanced at the end of every month and managers tracking such indices have to extend duration. A common and liquid instrument they could use to achieve this duration extension is to buy 10y bond futures.
Construction
	The Global End of Month Strategy takes a long 10y Government bond futures position 2 days prior to month-end and closes out the position at month-end. The strategy is a basket of End of Month strategies in 4 regions: US, Germany, Japan and UK
Diversification
	The End of Month Strategy only has exposure close to month-end and has therefore low correlation to the other Risk Premium Strategies
Persistence
	Historically the End of Month effect (bonds and futures increasing in price prior to month-end) has persisted. However the strategy can suffer losses if this effect were to weaken or reverse in the future.
